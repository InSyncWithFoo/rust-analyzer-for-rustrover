# Rust Analyzer for RustRover

[Rust Analyzer][1] is good, and so does [RustRover][2].
However, the best is when you can combine them.


## Usage

You must [have Rust Analyzer installed][3] to use this plugin.
The executable will then be detected and
invoked automatically on file open.

Additionally, if you are using IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm Community Edition,
[the LSP4IJ plugin][4] must be installed and enabled.
Once it is installed, change the running mode to <i>LSP4IJ</i>.
